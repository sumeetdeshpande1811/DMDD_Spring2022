Instructions for Q4:

Create a Department table with the following columns and values and use that to run your procedure test cases:
CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENT(
           dept_id number(5) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
           dept_name varchar(40) NOT NULL,
           dept_location varchar(40) NOT NULL);
